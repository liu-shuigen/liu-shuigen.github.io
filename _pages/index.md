I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at National University of Singapore.
My advisors are [Prof. Xin T. Tong](https://sites.google.com/view/xintongthomson/home) and [Prof. Weizhu Bao](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/matbwz/).
I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics at Peking University. 

My research focus on analysis and development of dimension reduction methods in sampling and inverse problems. 
I am broadly interested in uncertainty quantification and data assimilation as well.
